Hi viewer

This is the first of a series.
I'm trying to document my progress with JS and get better.

This is a Password Strength Indicator in which the mesage and the border change color depending on the value of the input. 
In order to acheive this, I used the id of the input, the class of the message and the class of the span which chnages depending on the value of the input

Thanks for checking this out. Kindly check out my other projects
